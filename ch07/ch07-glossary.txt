eigenvector - a vector x such that:
    - given a square matrix M where M is symmetric about the diagonal
    - given a number λ
        => Mx = λx

eigenvalue - a value λ such that
    - given a square matrix M where M is symmetric about the diagonal
    - given a vector x
        => Mx = λx

theorem: n by n correlation & covariance matrices have n real, orthogonal eigenvectors with n real eigenvalues

R: a symmetric, square matrix, where each column is a unit vector
    - Rij = 1 if i == j

E: (e_1 e_2) OR (e_1 e_2 ... e_n)
V: (λ_1 0  ) OR λ_1 ... λ_n along diagonals, etc.
   (0   λ_2)

RE = EV

TRANSPOSE OF PRODUCT OF MATRICES
(MN)^T = N^T %*% M^T

for all vectors x:
Ix = x
xI = x

R = RI = R(EE^T) = (RE)E^T = EVE^T
