dot product (inner product)
    useful for finding angle between 2 vectors
length of a vector x
    sqrt( x^Tx )

angle theta between 2 vectors x and y is theta such that:
    cos( theta ) = x^Ty / |x| * |y|
    *to get theta, aply arccos fn to this equation

Logarithmic modification
    log(f + 1) lessens the impact of frequent words
    doesn't do a GREAT job of reducing noise

Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)
    - The less a term appears in a collection of documents, the higher its value of IDF.
    - with N = total # of documents, N_t is total documents containing the term:
        IDF_t = log( N / N_t )
    - affect: as N_t gets larger, ITF of a term gets smaller
