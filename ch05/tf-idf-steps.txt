Simple TF-IDF Steps for Poe
1. All words are counted, which produces the term frequencies
2. The number of stories in which each word appears is counted, which are the document frequencies
3. The TF-IDF values are computed
4. The document vectors are normalized (each item divided by its column's length [i.e. magnitude i.e. inner product with its row vector => sum map { $_ ** 2 } @column])
5. The cosines are computed by taking the inner products
