P(E|F) = P(E and F) / P(F)
P(E|F) = ( n(E and F)/n ) / ( n(F)/n )
ergo: P(E|F) = n(E and F) / n(F)

MULTIPLICATION RULE
P(E and F) = P(E)*P(F) when E and F are independent
the closer 'and' is to '*', the more likely events are to be independent

95% confidence formula
(Y_bar - w 2(s_Y/sqrt(n)), Y-bar + 2(2_Y/sqrt(Y))
